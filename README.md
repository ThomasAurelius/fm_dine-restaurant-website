## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-  View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
-  See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
-  See the correct content for the Family Gatherings, Special Events, and Social Events section when the user clicks each tab
-  Receive an error message when the booking form is submitted if:
   -  The `Name` or `Email Address` fields are empty should show "This field is required"
   -  The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
   -  Any of the `Pick a date` or `Pick a time` fields are empty should show "This field is incomplete"

## My process

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  CSS custom properties
-  Flexbox
-  CSS Grid
-  Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I still need to figure out how the official design formatted the inputs the way the way they did. All other visuals are complete

### Useful resources
